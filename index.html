      	And I picture you<br>
		<em>Soaked</em> in light<br>
		I picture you<br>
		And in you I had no doubt<br>
		When the chaos calls me out<br>
		And it feel it's like there is nothing I can do<br>
		I picture you
    </h2>
    <p>
     		If I could tell you "no"<br>
		I thought it best you didn't know<br>
		Don't see it coming<br>
		The darkness visible<br>
		But when its eyes fix mine<br>
		The silver in its stone<br>
		I feel it rising, oh<br>
		The gathering storm<br>
		And when I feel a darkness is a heartbeat away<br>
		And I don't know how to fight it<br>
		It's a heartbeat away<br>
		And now<br>
		You don't know me like this<br>
		It's a heartbeat away<br>
		And I don't know how to hide it<br>
		It's a heartbeat away<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    		And I picture you<br>
		Soaked in light<br>
		I picture you<br>
		And in you I had no doubt<br>
		When the chaos calls me out<br>
		And it feel it's like there is nothing I can do<br>
		I picture you<br>
		And the night falls fast<br>
		I know it's heavy on the skin<br>
		Will it be ever thus?<br>
		They're barely visible<br>
		But when your eyes fix mine<br>
		Embracing you tonight<br>
		When I hold my breath<br>
		Through the waste and the while
    <p>
     		When I feel it rising<br>
		It's a heartbeat away<br>
		And I don't know how to fight it<br>
		It's a heartbeat away<br>
		And now<br>
		You don't know me like this<br>
		It's a heartbeat away<br>
		And I<br>
		Don't know how to fight it<br>
		It's a heartbeat away
